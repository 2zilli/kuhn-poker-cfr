        "\n",
        "The `CFRAgent` implements the Chance Sampling method of the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm. This method is designed to reduce computational complexity by sampling outcomes at chance nodes during the traversal of the game tree. Despite the sampling at chance nodes, the agent fully explores all possible actions available to the players at decision nodes, making it a comprehensive approach to learning optimal strategies in two-player zero-sum games.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features of the `CFRAgent`:\n",
        "- **Chance Sampling CFR**: Utilizes a chance-sampled game tree to minimize computation time per iteration while maintaining effective exploration of strategic options.\n",
        "- **Exhaustive Player Action Exploration**: At each decision node, all potential actions are considered, ensuring thorough evaluation of possible strategies.\n",
        "- **Adaptive Strategy Improvement**: Continuously refines strategies based on accumulated regret values for each action, progressively approaching an optimal Nash equilibrium strategy.\n",
        "- **Broad Applicability**: While specifically effective in two-player zero-sum games, the principles underpinning this agent are applicable across various game types that feature multiple agents and sequential decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Operation Details:\n",
        "- **Strategy and Regret Management**: The agent keeps track of regret values for each action at every information set, which guide the adjustment of action probabilities in future iterations based on past performance.\n",
        "- **Iterative Strategy Optimization**: The agent adjusts its strategic approach by increasing the probabilities of actions with higher regret values, thus refining its strategy towards the Nash equilibrium over numerous iterations.\n",
        "- **Efficiency in Complex Environments**: By employing Chance Sampling, the `CFRAgent` efficiently manages computational resources while thoroughly exploring strategic options, making it suitable for complex, multi-agent environments with imperfect information.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this section, we initiate and train a `CFRAgent` specifically tailored for Kuhn Poker. The CFR agent utilizes the Chance Sampling technique to optimize its strategy towards a Nash equilibrium over iterative self-play. Below are the steps followed in training and evaluating the agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialize the Agent**:\n",
        "   - An instance of `CFRAgent` is created with Kuhn Poker as the game environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Loading**:\n",
        "   - The system attempts to load a pre-existing trained model from `kuhn_cfr_model.pkl`. If no model is found, training starts from scratch. This approach allows for continuous improvement of the agent as more training iterations can be built upon previously learned strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training Process**:\n",
        "   - The agent undergoes a specified number of training iterations; in this case, 1,000,000. Each iteration represents a self-play game where the agent plays against itself, refining its strategy based on the outcomes and improving its understanding of the game dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Strategy Visualization**:\n",
        "   - After training, the agent's strategy is displayed. This showcases how the agent's decision-making has evolved over the training iterations, reflecting a move towards optimal play.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Saving**:\n",
        "   - Post training, the current state of the agent (including its strategy sums and regret values) is saved back to `kuhn_cfr_model.pkl`. This model saving enables the preservation of strategic developments and provides a checkpoint that can be reloaded in future sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Performance Reflection**:\n",
        "   - The total number of iterations completed during training is printed, providing a metric of the agent's experience and the computational effort involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "This methodology ensures a systematic approach to developing a robust CFR agent capable of approaching theoretical optimal strategies in Kuhn Poker through computational learning and iterative self-improvement.\n"

        "\n",
        "The `BestResponseAgent` is designed to identify and exploit the best responses to strategies developed by other agents, such as those trained via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR). This agent plays a crucial role in validating the robustness and optimality of learned strategies by attempting to exploit any possible weaknesses systematically.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Strategy Profile Maintenance**: Maintains a record of average rewards associated with each action at different game states (information sets). This allows the agent to choose actions that historically yielded the highest rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Action Selection**:\n",
        "  - For each decision point, the agent selects the action with the highest average reward based on past encounters within the same information set.\n",
        "  - If no historical data is available for the current state, it defaults to a random action selection, ensuring variability in play and exploration of new strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Experience Recording**:\n",
        "  - After each game, the agent records the outcomes associated with each action taken at various states to update its strategy profile.\n",
        "  - This continual learning process refines its understanding of the game dynamics and optimal responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Model Persistence**:\n",
        "  - **Saving Models**: The agent's current strategy profile can be saved to a file, allowing long-term retention of learned strategies and easy reload for further refinement or evaluation.\n",
        "  - **Loading Models**: At initialization, the agent attempts to load a pre-existing strategy profile from a specified file. This feature facilitates cumulative learning where the agent resumes learning from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pretty Print Strategy**:\n",
        "  - Provides a formatted output of the learned strategy profile, detailing the average rewards for each action at different information sets. This output is invaluable for analysis and debugging of the agent's decision-making process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Usage Scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "The `BestResponseAgent` is typically used in a testing or simulation environment where it is tasked with playing against a pre-trained agent (like a CFR-based agent). By rigorously challenging the strategies of these trained agents, it helps in verifying their strength and identifying potential areas for improvement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Note:\n",
        "\n",
        "This agent is part of a broader framework where it interacts with various game types and other agents. It is crucial for the testing phase of strategy development, providing insights into the effectiveness of different strategies under adversarial conditions.\n"

        "\n",
        "The `GameplaySimulator` is designed to simulate gameplay between two agents, referred to as `hero` and `villain`, within a defined game setting like Kuhn or Leduc Poker. This class facilitates the interaction of strategies and tactics between competing agents, allowing for the dynamic training and assessment of agent behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Agent Interaction**:\n",
        "  - The simulator controls the sequence of gameplay, determining which agent takes action based on the game state and alternating control between the `hero` and `villain`.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Exploratory Game Play**:\n",
        "  - Each game is played to completion by recursively deciding actions for each agent based on the current game state until a terminal condition is met (e.g., all rounds are complete or a player folds).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Information Set Construction**:\n",
        "  - During gameplay, an information set for the `hero` is constructed that encapsulates the current state from the `hero`'s perspective. This typically includes the hero's own cards and the action history, forming the basis for decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adaptability Note**:\n",
        "  - The current implementation of the `GameplaySimulator` uses only one hero card for constructing the information set, which is adequate for games like Kuhn Poker. For games with more complex or multiple hole cards, this approach may need to be adapted to ensure a more comprehensive representation of the game state is considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Action Reward Mapping**:\n",
        "  - For every action available at a particular state, the simulator clones the game state, performs the action, and recursively evaluates the outcome. This approach captures the direct consequences of actions, informing the hero's strategy adjustments.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Strategy Updates**:\n",
        "  - After exploring all possible actions and their outcomes, the simulator updates the `hero`'s strategy based on the observed rewards. This continuous feedback loop enhances the `hero`'s decision-making process over multiple simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reward Return**:\n",
        "  - The simulator returns the reward of the chosen action, aiding in the assessment of strategy efficacy and decision-making processes over successive games.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Usage Scenario:\n",
        "\n",
        "The `GameplaySimulator` is integral to training scenarios where a `hero` agent is tested against a `villain` to refine strategies or to evaluate the robustness of a learned strategy against a predefined or adaptive adversary. It is particularly useful in environments where exhaustive exploration of game states is feasible and informative for agent learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Note:\n",
        "\n",
        "While designed to be generic enough to handle any two-player card game, the `GameplaySimulator` is optimized for games like Kuhn and Leduc Poker, where the complexity and depth of the game tree allow for comprehensive strategy development and testing. This class is a cornerstone of the training framework, ensuring agents can adapt and optimize their strategies in a controlled yet competitive setting.\n"

        "     - Simulating a complete game from the perspective of the Best Response Agent, allowing it to explore different actions and learn from the outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Exploring Game States**:\n",
        "   - For each training iteration, the game is played twice—once with the Best Response Agent starting the game and once with the CFR agent starting. This alternating start helps in providing balanced exposure to different game states, enhancing the learning and adaptability of the Best Response Agent.\n",

        "In this section, we simulate a large number of Kuhn Poker games between a pre-trained Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) agent and a Best Response agent. The simulation helps verify the effectiveness of the CFR strategy by alternately positioning the CFR agent as Player 0 and Player 1 against an adaptive opponent. This approach provides insights into the CFR agent's performance and adaptability under varied game conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Setup\n",
        "- **Game Initialization**: We use the `KuhnGame` class to create instances of the game.\n",
        "- **Agent Initialization**: The CFR agent is assumed to be pre-trained and is ready for testing. The Best Response agent is also initialized.\n",
        "- **Simulation Parameters**:\n",
        "  - `num_games`: The total number of games played, set to 1,000,000 to ensure robust statistical results.\n",
        "  - `payoff_records`: An array to track the cumulative payoffs for the CFR agent when it plays as Player 0 and Player 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simulation Process\n",
        "1. **CFR as Player 0**:\n",
        "   - For each game instance, the CFR agent acts as Player 0. The game progresses turn by turn between the CFR and Best Response agents until a terminal state (end of the game) is reached.\n",
        "   - Payoffs are recorded for the CFR agent at the end of each game.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **CFR as Player 1**:\n",
        "   - The roles are reversed, and the process is repeated with the CFR agent acting as Player 1. This setup tests the agent's strategies from both player perspectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Calculation of Results\n",
        "- **Average Payoff**:\n",
        "  - The average payoff for the CFR agent when it plays as Player 0 and Player 1 is calculated by dividing the total payoffs by the number of games. This measure evaluates the agent's overall performance against the Best Response agent.\n",
        "- **Theoretical Comparison**:\n",
        "  - According to game theory and prior analysis of Kuhn Poker, the expected average utility for Player 0 is -1/18 and for Player 1 is 1/18 under optimal play. Our results are compared against these benchmarks to assess the CFR agent's adherence to theoretically optimal strategies. For further reading on Kuhn Poker strategy and Nash equilibrium, visit [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker).\n",
        "\n",
        "The results from this simulation provide valuable insights into the strategic consistency and effectiveness of the CFR agent when confronted with a strategically optimized opponent. It also serves as a practical validation of the CFR algorithm's capability to approximate Nash equilibrium strategies in two-player zero-sum games like Kuhn Poker.\n",

        "The simulation of 1,000,000 games of Kuhn Poker provided a comprehensive evaluation of the Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) agent against a Best Response agent. Here's what we've learned and what's next:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Observations:\n",
        "- **Performance Consistency**: The CFR agent demonstrated its ability to perform close to the theoretical expectations derived from game theory, effectively approximating Nash equilibrium strategies in Kuhn Poker.\n",
        "- **Effectiveness of CFR**: The results confirm the effectiveness of the CFR algorithm in achieving outcomes that align closely with theoretical predictions, showcasing its reliability in strategic game settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Work:\n",
        "- **Exploring More Complex Games**: To further validate the algorithm's effectiveness, the next step involves applying CFR to Leduc Holdem, a more complex variant of poker that introduces greater decision-making complexity. [Placeholder for future Leduc Holdem Notebook](#).\n",
        "- **Integration with Neural Networks**: There is also an interest in integrating neural networks with CFR strategies. This initiative will explore whether combining these technologies can enhance or even surpass the strategic decision-making capabilities currently achieved by traditional CFR methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "These initiatives aim to deepen our understanding of game theory applications in AI, expanding their practical utility across a wider range of strategic games and decision-making environments.\n"
